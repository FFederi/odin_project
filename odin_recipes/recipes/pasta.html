<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Named after the friend that first introduced this dish to me one homesick day. It is a simple pasta that lends itself to endless variety. Try adding mushrooms or zucchini. I find that angel hair pasta is best, but thicker pasta will certainly work as well. Drizzle with extra olive oil before serving.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>5 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced </li>
    <li>1 pound angel hair pasta </li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, saute garlic in oil 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in onion and cook 2 minutes more. Stir in tomatoes, oregano, basil, salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low and let simmer.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
</ol>
