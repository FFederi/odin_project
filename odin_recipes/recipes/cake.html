<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is an old fashioned pudding cake, with cake and pudding layers in the pan.</p>
<p>The name is a play on words because the cake is made by basically pouring the ingredients and, also, because it is a cheap cake to to make ( Poor Cake). </p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour </li>
    <li>1 cup white sugar </li>
    <li>1 cup packed light brown sugar  </li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease one 9 inch square baking pan.
    </li>
    <li>Whisk together the flour, sugars, baking soda, cocoa and salt. Stir in the vegetable oil, vanilla and vinegar. Pour batter into the prepared pan and pour the water over the top. Draw a fork through the batter to just barely mix.</li>
</ol>
